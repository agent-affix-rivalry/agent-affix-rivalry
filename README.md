This Github contains the resources presented in the paper "Distributional semantics insights on agentive suffix rivalry in French" (Huyghe and Wauquier 2021). Resources are divided in three repositories:
- "data", which contains the lists of agent nouns (or seeds) used in the study
- "script", which contains the Jupyter Notebook (python 3) used to compute the distributional measures
- "results", which contains the lists of distributional neighbors for the 6 centroids we computed, the average proximity score (or density) of each seed to the other seeds for each suffix, and the result of the agent nouns clustering.
